Spaghetti 

Ingredients:

a box of spaghetti
a jar of marinara sauce
1-2 pounds of ground beef or Italian sausage
two large pots, one for boiling the pasta and the other for making the sauce
serving untensils
salt
water

How to cook it:

Before you start, fill up a large pot with water and add a handful of salt. Put it on the stove and turn it to high so it'll start boiling!
Next you will need to cook the of meat. Take all of the meat out of its container and set it all in a large pan, then put the pan on the stove and set the stove to medium
After that you will need to break the meat into smaller pieces
When the meat is in small pieces you will then need to start flipping the meat and make sure it gets brown all-around and cooked thoroughly 
The cooking should take approximately 10-15 minutes 
When all of the meat is brown and cooked you can add in the sauce
Next you will need to mix your marinara sauce with your cooked meat
Take your jar of marinara sauce and pour all of it on the cooked meat and then stir it all around until it is all blended together
Then turn the heat down to low and let it simmer while you cook the pasta
Once the water has come up to a boil, you can throw the spaghetti in. 
Typically it should cook within 7-11 minutes - just follow the time on the box!
Make sure to stir every couple minutes to keep it from sticking.
Depending on your timing, you can either strain the spaghetti and set it aside, or you can put it right into the sauce
